CopyDetect_1.2 (2014-08-06)

  * A small computational adjustment for the S2 index is made

CopyDetect_1.1 (2014-08-06)

  * A small computational error for the S2 index is fixed

  * An adjustment in the omega index was made to avoid possible problem when missing data occurs in response vectors.
    Now, it can handle both scenarios: 
      1) Missing data in response vectors are read as "NA",
      2) Missing data in response vectors are read as system missing in R

  * An error was fixed for print.CopyDetect2 function, an internal function to be used for printing the CopyDetect2 objects. 
    Previously it could handle only five option items, now it can handle any number of options, and printing does not have any problems.
